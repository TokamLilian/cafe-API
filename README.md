# This is the final and main project for a programming course at [Université de Montréal](https://admission.umontreal.ca/programmes/baccalaureat-en-informatique/)

This API can be used by students to send requests to the University Cafe

It is very useful because we often go to the cafe without being sure to get what we want, hence if beforehand we can make a request and/or get the information about the availability or not of a product, then that's hugely beneficial
